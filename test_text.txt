Arvika Gjuteri AB
Production began at Arvika Gjuteri in 1971, and now includes casting and processing of components in nodular and grey iron. Thanks to a large network of specialists we can also offer products with special requirements on, for example, induction hardening, ED/powder coating and assembly.

Arvika Gjuteri has a stable ownership situation, with Swedish Powertrain AB as its owner. Swedish Powertrain AB is equally owned by Sibbhultsverken Group AB and LEAX Group AB, two strong partners who, by their many years of industrial experience and competence, will strengthen our potential on the national and global market.

Today the company is licensed to produce approximately 35,000 tonnes of cast goods – historically the level has been around 25,000 tonnes a year. Thanks to an intensive investment programme, we now have a modern smelting plant equipped to cope with the today’s and tomorrow’s demands on quality and availability.
